# Pacman
School project - developing a version of Pacman using pygame

This will be a version of Pacman with the following features:
Shortest path finding algorithm for controlling ghosts
Different levels of difficulty - mainly depending on the 'intelligence' of the enemies
Available off-line, with retrievable high scores

This is my first project in Python using Github.
