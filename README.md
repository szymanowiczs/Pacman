# Pacman
School project - developing a version of Pacman using pygame

This will be a version of Pacman with the following features:
Breadth First Search for path finding for ghosts
Different levels of difficulty - mainly depending on the 'intelligence' of the enemies
Available off-line, with retrievable high scores


The description of the project can be found in a pdf document, in particular the principles of implementing BFS and explanation of how it governs the movement of the ghosts.
This is my first project in Python using Github.
